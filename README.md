# Mono-Asteroids

Asteroids implemented with Monogame and C#.

## Getting Started

Playing this implementation of Asteroids will require you to build a
working copy. The only dependency required for this application is
Monogame, which you can download from
[NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MonoGame.Framework.WindowsDX/).

Upon building the application the game should run, as the assets used
are also contained in this GitHub repository.
